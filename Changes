	* DEVELOPER'S RELEASE - the save() function does not work, but
	the load() function does (should, might, etc.).  I still do not
	understand the entire format, but I can pull out the stuff that
	HTTP::Cookies needs.

0.91 - Sat Mar 12 00:03:34 2005
	* Added POD coverage tests
	* no code changes: no need to upgrade

0.91 - Fri Sep 17 13:22:59 2004
 * distribution cleanups: no need to upgrade

 problems
