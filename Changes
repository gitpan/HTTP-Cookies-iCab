0.90_01 - Thu Jan  9 04:30:48 2003
	* DEVELOPER'S RELEASE - the save() function does not work, but
	the load() function does (should, might, etc.).  I still do not
	understand the entire format, but I can pull out the stuff that
	HTTP::Cookies needs.

1.120 - Wed Aug  6 08:46:38 2008
	* Fix to Cookies.dat file to ensure the cookies don't expire
	so the tests don't fail
	* Note in docs that this does not yet support iCab 4

1.09 - Wed Jan 10 18:07:32 2007
	* Fixed endian bug in date reading. Now that Macs have Intel, that
	matters.
	* Updated license stuff.
	* Everyone should upgrade.

1.07 - Thu Jul 20 16:52:24 2006
	* Fixed up one of the tests which failed due to an expiring cookie
	in the test test. Three years ago seems like a long time now. :)
	* No need to upgrade if you already have this installed.

1.05 - Sat Mar 12 00:08:29 2005
	* Added POD coverage tests
	* no code changes: no need to upgrade

0.91 - Sat Mar 12 00:03:34 2005
	* Added POD coverage tests
	* no code changes: no need to upgrade

0.91 - Fri Sep 17 13:22:59 2004

 problems
